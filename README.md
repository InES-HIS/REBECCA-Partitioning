# REBECCA-Partitioning
----

## Introduction

Repository for the AI-modekl partitioning part of the REBECCA project.
This part was performed by the High Integrity Systems (HIS) group at the Institute of Embedded Systems (InES), School of Engineering, Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW).

## Aim of Project
The aim of the REBECCA project is to generate a reference architecture using RISC-Vs and a chiplet design for FPGA and AI-accelerators.

The motivation for this part of the project is the necessity of partitioning AI-models across the architecture for both critical and non-critical processing.
